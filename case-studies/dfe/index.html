   <h1>Teachers Student Loan Reimbursement</h1>
   <p>Department for Education is a ministerial department, responsible for children’s services and education, including early years, schools, higher and further education policy, apprenticeships and wider skills in England.</p>
   <p>They needed to build a service that delivered a policy commitment to reimburses teacher’s student loans for secondary teachers who taught languages, science and computing.</p>
  
   <h2>Alpha</h2>
   <p>DfE uses the <a class="link-color" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery">Government Digital Service</a> model for phases of an agile project.</p>
   <p>A team was formed to deliver a 12 week Alpha phase to stand up the first version of the service using research from a 6 week discovery.</p>
   <p>I divided my time between service design and user research.</p>
  
   <h2>User Research</h2>
   <p>Over 7 sprints, working with a junior user researcher, we recruited participants and ran research to build evidence for the service. We spoke to 111 eligible users and mapped all the insights back to every step in the service journey. We used different methods including phone interviews, face-to-face, lab sessions and pop-up interviews at a teaching event.</p>

   <h2>Orchestrating the layers of the service</h2>
   <p class="list-margin">I collaborated with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>product manager and interaction designer to create a working prototype of the digital service</li>
      <li>a technical architect and and other ministerial departments (for example HMRC) to bring together supporting systems that would be needed. Eg verify</li>
    </ul>

    </div>

   <h2>Outcome</h2>
   <p class="list-margin">We delivered:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>a digital prototype of the end-to-end service</li>
    <li>a hypothesis board of evidence relating to all the steps in the service</li>
    <li>a service blueprint that detailed every step in the service in relation to all systems and policy criteria needed to deliver the service</li>
   </ul>
